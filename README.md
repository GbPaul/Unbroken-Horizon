# Unbroken-Horizon

The Aim of the project is to be able to save data from database and present the 
information in a user interface that has the basic funtionality as describe be low.



The interface must provide the possibility to change presentation language dynamically, e.g., between Swedish and Chinese, or English and Greek (or some other combinations). 
All text has to be translated!
There should be at least one implementation of Drag and Drop, where you have to use JavaScript to change some element in the interface. 
This will be explained further in one of the lectures. 
The interface should support multi-level Undo-Redo, i.e., it should be possible to undo (and redo) multiple actions in a sequence. 
The interface should be resizable, i.e., you must apply a responsive design approach to your application. 
At least two significantly different sizes of the display should be supported (e.g., laptop or tablet and mobile). 

Functionalilties 
You can drag and drop from the menu to the orders list and edit orders with the X button.
Undo and redo remembers states but is still a bit buggy, drag and drop works, responsive design works but could be refined,
Switching language is working but functionalities for Chinese page is not fixed. 
MVC is yet to be fixed
